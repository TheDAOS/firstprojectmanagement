        <h4>Buyer FAQ</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Why was a hold/charge placed on my credit card?</b>
            <br><br>
            When you place a bid on Cars & Bids, we put a hold on your credit card for the 4.5% buyer's fee based on your bid (minimum $225, maximum $4,500). This is a pending charge which is removed at auction end if you do not win the car, and within a few days will disappear from your card's transaction history. On the other hand, should you win, you will be charged at auction end.
